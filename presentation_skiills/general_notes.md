# how-to-give-a-team-presentation

Advice for Team Presentations:
* Start with strongest presenter
* Finish with strongest or second strongest presenter
* Start by determining the main messages, then work on figuring out who will present each point.
* Don't restate what others have said in the meeting. Make sure each statement is unique and interesting.

Limit the presentation to 5 points. Do not try to include more as people will not be able to remember so much.
* Create a story for every one of the message points
* Use a real story. You want to avoid abstraction in a meeting. If the audience can't see it in their mind, they won't be able to remember it.
* If you can't come up with a story for the point then it's not an important point!
* Don't just read the powerpoint. Why? You can't give eye contact, and it's boring because people can read the slides themselves without you.
* At the end of the day, will people remember the slide or not? If not, it's not effective.
* He says avoid text in a powerpoint. He admits this is crazy talk - but says it works. Instead of text, use a picture.
* Instead of a visual in a slide you could use a prop.

Don't just dump data on people - audience will zone out and start checking emails / etc.

All presentations should be interesting - it doesn't matter if it's technical, financial, etc. How can you make it interesting and engaging?

Conciseness is not the end all be all goal of a presentation. If you have a point you want people to remember you are better off giving a story (long or otherwise) to make it meaningful.

Review your presentation and focus / improve one thing at a time.

Record, watch, and re-do the presentation until you are very happy with it. You don't send an email until you are happy with the content - same concept with a presentation. Focus on the rehearsal with video rather than tinkering with slides and slide content.

Don't turn your camera off because it makes it boring for people. You want to connect with your audience so they're engaged.
